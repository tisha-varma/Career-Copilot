## 📖 Project Description
**Career Copilot AI** is a professional-grade career optimization platform that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with cloud-native infrastructure to transform static resumes into strategic career assets. 

In a modern job market driven by ATS and precise role-fit, Career Copilot provides job seekers with **semantic analysis**, **predictive interview intelligence**, and **automated asset generation**. It doesn't just scan for keywords; it understands the *intent* and *impact* of a user's professional journey, bridging the gap between current experience and future goals.
